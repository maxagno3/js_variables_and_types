# Logical Operator

1. ðŸ¥‡What's the output of the following, write the output next to the code as comment.

* [ ] Logical AND operation

```js
true  && true; //output
true  && false; //true
false && true; //false
false && false; //false
"foo" && "bar"; //bar
"bar" && "foo"; //foo
"foo" && "";    //""
""    && "foo"; //""
" "   && "John" && "" && false //""
false && "Hey" && undefined //false
"undefined" && false && 42 // false
```

* [ ] Logical OR operation
```js
true  || true; //true
true  || false; //true
false || true; //true
false || false; //false
"foo" || "bar"; //foo
"bar" || "foo"; //bar
"foo" || ""; //foo
""    || "foo"; //foo
" "   || "John" || "" || false //" "
false || "Hey" || undefined //Hey
"undefined" || false || 42 //undefined
```

2. ðŸ¥ˆYou have two variables i.e `isGuestOneVeg` and  `isGuestTwoVeg` according to the value using logical && and || opeartor do the following.

* [ ] If both are veg "Only offer up vegan dishes."
* [ ] At least one veg  "Make sure to offer up some vegan options."
* [ ] Else, "Offer up anything on the menu"
```js
let isGuestOneVeg = false;
let isGuestTwoVeg = false;

if(isGuestOneVeg || isGuestTwoVeg){
    alert('Only Offer up vegan dishes')
}else if(isGuestOneVeg && isGuestTwoVeg){
    alert('Make sure to offer up some vegan dishes')
}else{
    alert('Offer up anything on the menu');
}
// Your code goes here
```


3. ðŸŽ–Using the variable `temperature` and logical operators do the following
* [ ] If temperature is less then 32 alert "It is freezing outside"
* [ ] If the temperature is greater then 110 alert "It is hot outside"
* [ ] else 'Go for it. It is pretty nice out'
```js
let temperature = 4;
((temperature < 32) && alert('It is freezing outside')) || ((temperature > 110) && alert('It is hot outside'));
// Your code goes here
```

4. ðŸŽ– Output of this and the reason behind the output.
```js
alert( alert(1) || 2 || alert(3) );
alert(1) and then 2 as || operator searches for the first truthy value and both alert(1) and alert(3) displays undefined and is returned undefined
```
